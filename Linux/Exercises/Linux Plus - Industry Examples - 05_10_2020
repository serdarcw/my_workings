Excercise - User and groups
Write a script that; 
Creates a user account by asking user to enter a user name
Prints error if user already exists
Asks user to enter description for new user
Adds the description to the new user account
Prints message that user successfully created.
Asks user to enter a group name
If group name is empty script will do nothing.
If given group name does not exist create a group
Add user to the group
Print message that user successfully added to the group

Solution:
read -p "Enter the user name: " username
grep $username /etc/passwd
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
        echo "User already exists!"
        exit 1
fi

useradd $username
read -p "Enter a description for $username user: " desc
usermod -c "$desc" $username
echo "$username successfully created."
read -p "Enter the group name to add $username : " group
if [ $group ]
then
        grep $group /etc/group

        if [ $? -gt 0 ]
        then
                groupadd $group
        fi
        gpasswd -a $username $group
        echo "$username added to the group $group."
fi

Excercise Delete old files
Step 1: Write a script to delete files older than 10 days
Step 2: Modify your script to get day reference from the first argument

Solution
files=$(find . -mtime +$1 -name "*.txt")
for file in $files
do
        rm $file
        echo "$file was deleted!"
done


Excercise - File watcher
Write a script that checks whether clarusway.txt exists in the current directory.
If file is found the script will delete the file and prints a message.
Run the script on the background.
Test the script
Terminate the script


while :
do
        sleep 15
        echo "Checking file!Checking file!
        fc=$(find . -name "clarusway.txt" | wc -l)
        if [ $fc -gt 0 ]
        then
                rm clarusway.txt
                echo "clarusway.txt found and deleted"
        fi
done
